    "titleOfTheDocument": "CERTIFIED REFERENCE MATERIAL BAM-U026",
    "periodOfValidity": "This certificate is valid for a period of 12 months starting with the dispatch of the reference material from BAM.",
    "dataOfIssue": "Accepted as a BAM-CRM on December 13, 2023",
    "MaterialCode": "BAM-U026",
    "desctiption": "**Material Description**\n\nReference material BAM-U026 was obtained by blending a sandy loamy soil from a contaminated site in Berlin, Germany with a TPH free sandy loamy soil sampled near Berlin, Germany. After air-drying, sieving fractions < 125 µm were mixed, homogenized, and subdivided into 70 g which were filled in amber glass bottles with screw caps equipped with PTFE-inserts and sealed with shrinking foil. The material is stored at BAM at -20 °C until dispatch. Details of the preparation and characterization procedures are specified in the certification report.",

    "StorageInformation": "**Transport and Storage**\nThe stability of the content of TPH allows dispatching the material at ambient temperature. On receiving, it is to be stored at -20 °C. Before withdrawing a subsample the bottle must have reached ambient temperature. Thereafter, the bottle must be closed tightly and stored at -20 °C again.",
    "instructionsForHandlingAndUse": "**Recommended Use**\nBAM-U026 is explicitly meant only to be used in analytical laboratories. The intended purpose of reference material BAM-U026 is the verification of analytical procedures equivalent to ISO 16703:2011 for the determination of the TPH content in soils and sediments by GC-FID. It is strongly recommended to handle and dispose of the reference material in accordance with the guidelines for analytical soil samples legally in force at the site of end use and disposal.\n\n**Transport and Storage**\nThe stability of the content of TPH allows dispatching the material at ambient temperature. On receiving, it is to be stored at -20 °C. Before withdrawing a subsample the bottle must have reached ambient temperature. Thereafter, the bottle must be closed tightly and stored at -20 °C again.",
    "metrologicalTraceability": "**Metrological Traceability**\nThe total petroleum hydrocarbon content is defined by the method employed for its determination. The certified value is the mass fraction of mineral oil obtained by the analytical procedure according to ISO 16703:2011 in relation to the certified calibration standard BAM-K010g. Thus, the stated references for BAM-U026 are ISO 16703:2011 and the calibration standard BAM-K010g mentioned for this purpose therein.",
