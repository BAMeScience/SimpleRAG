Additional material information  
CRM BAM -U117 is available as a powder with particle sizes below 125 µm and is 
supplied in 100 mL amber glass bottles containing (77 ± 1) g.  
The dry mass  content of the bottled soil material at the time of certification was  
(99.64 ± 0.2 7) %, corresponding to a drying temperature of (10 5 ± 2) °C. The 
indicated uncertainty represents the standard deviation of the mean of 1 5 laboratory 
results . The indicated  value of the dry mass content should be regarded as being 
indicative.  
 
Recommended Use  
The intended purpose of CRM BAM -U117 is the verification of analytical results 
obtained for the mass fraction of total cyanide in soils and soil -like materials 
applying the standardized procedures DIN ISO 11262:2012  [1] and DIN EN ISO 
17380:2013  [2]. As any reference material, it can also be used for routine 
performance checks (quality control charts) or validation studies.

 BAM-U117  (Vers. 1) Page 2 of 4 pages  Material  Description  
The CRM BAM -U117 represents a mixture of a sandy soil collected from a contaminated 
former gasworks area in the Berlin region (Germany) and an unpolluted sandy soil from 
Nalaikh region (Mongolia). The raw materials were dried at ambient air to constant mass, 
and afterwards the fractions passing a 2 mm screen were ground to particle sizes below 
125 µm. Before bottling, the two fractions were mixed and homogenized.  
For the main matrix constituents of the bottled material the following non -certified 
results were obtained by X -ray fluorescence analysis (WD -XRF):  
Element  Si Al K Na Ca Fe 
Mass fraction in %  35.6 6.9 2.9 2.5 0.8 0.8 
Mass fractions of other elements detectable with WD -XRF were less than 0.2 %.  
 
Further informative analytical results obtained during  sample characterization from 
original material BAM -U116/CGL306:  
 
Parameter  Mass fraction (in %)  Analytical method  
Loss on ignition at 550 °C  0.9 EN 15935 [ 3] 
Total carbon (TC)  0.2 ISO 10694 [ 4] 
 
Instructions for Use  
Before withdrawing a sub-sample, the bottle should be allowed to reach room 
temperature. Thereafter, the bottle should be closed tightly and stored at (4 ± 2) °C. The 
stability of the reference material is not affected by short periods of handling at ambient 
temperature during transport and use.  
The minimum sample size for a determination is 5 g.  
When determining the content of total cyanide, the analytical protocol prescribed by DIN 
ISO 11262:2012  or DIN EN ISO 17380:2013 must strictly be followed. All analytical 
results have to be corrected for dry mass content of the material which should be 
determined according to ISO 11465:1993 [5] using a separate sub -sample. The value 
given in the table below  (99.6 4 %) should be regarded as being indicative only.

CRM BAM -U117 can be shipped at ambient temperature. Upon receipt the material has to 
be stored at a temperature of (4 ± 2) °C in its original tightly closed bottle.  
 
Metrological Traceability  
The certified mass fraction of total cyanide in CRM BAM -U117 is operationally -defined 
referring to the analytical protocol s prescribed by DIN ISO 11262:2011 and DIN EN ISO 
17380:2013. The photometric determination of the liberated cyanide is traceable to the 
International System of Units (SI) via calibration using substances with certified analyte 
content.
